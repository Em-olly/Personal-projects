Write an Express.js server with three GET endpoints:

/coinFlip which accepts a query parameter times (default 1), flips a coin 
that many times, and returns a JSON object with the key "result" containing 
an array of outcomes ("Heads" or "Tails").

/diceRoll which accepts a query parameter times (default 1), rolls a 
six-sided dice that many times, and returns a JSON object with the key 
"result" containing an array of the roll results.

/randomNumber which accepts optional query parameters min and max 
(default 1 and 100 respectively), validates that min is less than max, 
and returns a JSON object with the key "result" containing a single random 
number within the range [min, max].
Provide the complete Express.js code implementing this functionality.
